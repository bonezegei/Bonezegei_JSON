# Bonezegei_JSON



Bonezegei_JSON is a lightweight, Arduino-compatible JSON serialization library designed for constrained embedded environments. Developed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, it enables microcontrollers to encode and decode structured data with minimal overhead, making it ideal for serial communication, IoT messaging, and real-time telemetry workflows.

Unlike full-featured JSON parsers, Bonezegei_JSON focuses on core functionality—supporting basic key-value serialization and deserialization—while maintaining a small memory footprint. This makes it particularly suitable for low-resource devices such as the ESP32, ATmega328, and similar platforms.

The library is part of the Bonezegei ecosystem, which aims to streamline embedded development through modular, reusable tools. Bonezegei_JSON has been successfully integrated into serial-to-WebSocket bridges, local HTTP servers, and long polling clients, demonstrating its versatility in hardware-software integration workflows
